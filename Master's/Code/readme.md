Generic model!
===================


Project created as my **master thesis** practical part. It contains code which translates mermaid conceptual model into working simulation.

----------

How do I run it?
-------------------
Navigate ModelParser folder in the project. Then you want to run following in command line:
>`node EntryPoint.js`

You will also need Node.js installed on your machine as well as python 3.x.

Conceptual model documentation
-------------

All information about model is taken from mermaid defined model. Following information gives you an idea how you can modify model to achieve wanted results:

- Links:
	- to - time out i.e. `to50`;

- Components:
	- dr - death rate i.e. `dr5` from 0 to 100 in percentages;
